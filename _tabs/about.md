Hi, I'm Nayeem Islam Ramim aka **nayeems3c** â€” a passionate **Bug Bounty Hunter** and **CTF player** from Bangladesh.

I enjoy solving challenges related to web and forensics. When I'm not hunting for bugs or playing CTFs with my team **Cyb3r_W4rM0ng3rs**, I'm learning new techniques, tools, and staying up to date with the latest in cybersecurity.

I secured many companies like Department of Defense (DoD), Sony, Thales, ESET, LG, Samsung, Drexel University, Stanford University and so on.
